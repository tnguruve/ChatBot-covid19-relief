# ChatBot-covid19-relief
Artificial intelligence in healthcare    About: In this Python project, I’m building  a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses. I wanted to make a generative based chatbot not based on predefined input patterns but based on neural networks(this process needs a lot of data though). It being based on neural networks means it is using artificial intelligence.  Passion: Creating Technologies that benefit the developing countries and the minority.   What inspired me Bias that black people don’t need therapy, Poor detection rate due to poor health systems caused by the increasingly bad socioeconomic environment(Zimbabwe), Suicide rates going up.           https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734988/
